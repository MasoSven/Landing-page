### Portfolio Plan

I want a single page website with no redirecting. All content must be contained on this one page. Project details should appear in modal form. This keeps the website looking and feeling more streamlined and consistent.

1. Hero Section
   - Greeting + name
   - Who am I?
   - What do I do?
   - Social links
   - Resume link/download
   - Button to scroll to the next section

2. What I do
   - About me blurb (one sentence)
     - How my experience relates to my current skillset
     - Bold important words
   - Card 1 'Experience': My history and experience
   - Card 2 'Tech': A brief overview of my technical knowledge
   - Card 3 'Character': Misc. and hobbies

3. Skills
   - Experience blurb (one sentence)
   - List of skills in badge form
   - List of Udemy certificates

4. Projects
   - Projects blurb (one sentence)
     - What type of projects do I work on?
   - Grid of images of projects (Gallery)
     - Important projects are bigger in the grid
     - Each project can be clicked, and opens a lightbox with more information

5. Footer
   - Social icons
   - Copyright text
