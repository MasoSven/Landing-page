## About Me

Hi, I'm Olin. I'm a German-American software developer living and working in Cologne, Germany.

My favorite projects involve developing user-friendly applications or games. My main experience is in front-end development and I also have a passion for design. Since creating modern applications usually involves a combination of development and design, I think having experience in both makes for a better end result and user experience.

I've created applications for museum exhibits, developed front-end solutions for security system management, and most recently worked on mobile games in Cologne.

In the past, I've primarily used ActionScript and Flex, but picking up a new framework or language isn't a problem. Agnostic of the platform, I'm dedicated to developing software that adheres to best practices and straight forward design patterns. Recently, I've been pivoting my skillset to modern front-end technologies like HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

Outside of my work I like traveling, designing fictional worlds, hiking, and playing strategy games online with my friends.
